We are your guides to making the most of your eclipse experience. We will be documenting our own eclipse experience as we journey to Eastern Oregon for the ultimate astronomical event.

Return here often to discover the significance of an eclipse and unique ways for everybody to enjoy this rare and brief event.

We are launching this site 2 months before the [eclipse of August 21st, 2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_August_21,_2017). This will remain as a resource for all those who wish to experience an eclipse in the future.

Please feel free to ask questions and we will try to incorporate answers in our future posts.
