We are your guides to making the best of your eclipse experience. We will be documenting our own eclipse experience as we journey to Eastern Oregon for the ultimate astronomical event.

Return here often to discuss the significance of an eclipse and unique ways for everybody to get the most from the rare and brief event.

We are launching this site 2 months before the [eclipse of August 21st, 2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_August_21,_2017). This will remain as a resource for all those who wish to experience an eclipse in the future.

Please feel free to ask questions and we will try and incorporate answers to them in our future posts.
